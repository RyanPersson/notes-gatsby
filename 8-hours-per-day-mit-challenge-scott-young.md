## Scott young's tips on MIT challenge (Four year MIT degree in 12 months)

"The first major advantage I had was simply that I never studied in the evenings or on the weekends. Even when I was putting in 50-60 hours per week to prepare for an exam the next day, I would never study overtime."

---

"If you don’t schedule your off hours, your brain will do it for you—by procrastinating, getting distracted and losing focus."

---

"The key to taking breaks intelligently however, is to pick an activity as a break that is more boring than actually studying. A break shouldn’t be fun, it should be relaxing."

"I never denied myself a break"

"Focus is a lot like weight training. Yes, some people start off with unusually strong and athletic. But if you go to the gym every day and lift weights, almost everyone will eventually get stronger. Similarly, if you spend time engaged in deep focus each day, you will be able to slowly stretch that capacity and deepen it."

### How to stop forgetting things you read.

Recall vs Recognition.
We WANT recall but train for recognition when reading.

 "If you’re reading a well-written book, you may never have to use recall as good writers know that recall is difficult and so they will often reiterate previously made points so that you don’t get confused."

BETTER note taking technique.
"Question" book. Write in your notes, a list of questions whose answers are the things you want to remember. 
Instead of Trying to write down the things you want to recall, write down the **questions** referencing what you want to recall. (Anki good for this?) Keep using Anki

"Then, when you’re reading a book, quickly go through and test yourself on the questions you’ve generated from earlier chapters. Doing this will strengthen your recallable memory so that the information will be much easier to access when you need it."

---

"One question per chapter is probably more than enough for most books. Don't go overboard."

---

"Second—put page numbers which reference the answer." Tip for referencing the question incase you get it wrong.


"For paper books, I recommend an index card, since you can probably fit all of the questions on it back and front. Plus the index card also works as a bookmark, so you won’t have to go around looking for your notes later."

MD card for digital book?

"dedicated notebook to work alongside your textbook."

Test driven learning.
Like test driven development. Start by writing a TEST a method by which you can tell WHEN you have learned a subject. Exam like or whatever.

This gives you a way to have [[feedback]] on whether you're learning succesfully

(same in [[test-driven-development]])

"by taking the test first, you can make a mental assessment of how the knowledge needs to be used before you take the class. Then, once you’re in the class, you’re already primed to think about the knowledge in the way that will help you retake the test again."

### Lazy Way. Just grab a test before studying a subject.
