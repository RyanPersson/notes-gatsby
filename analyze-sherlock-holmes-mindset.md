Analyze that way of thinking, Is it actually possible?

For an entity to be able to accurately make inferences about the world it see. It needs to have enough domain experience to infer based on small, "insignificant" signals.

It needs to be able to read the signal in the noise based on VERY specific domain experience.

This will be hard to gather.


Needs to have an accurate enough internal model of the world & way things fit together in order to be able to predict/judge
