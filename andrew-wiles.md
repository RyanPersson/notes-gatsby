### What problem-solving method did Andrew Wiles likely use to solve Fermat's Last Theorem?
Arguably one of the hardest things a human has done.


First, studied it since he was a kid. It was the problem on the back of his mind for his entire life. 
see [[feynman-technique]] 

    maintain a working list of "Your" hard problems (and solutions) so that the creative graph search mechanisms in your mind can test them as potential nodes in other domains, through your whole life.

Second. he LIKELY worked backwards from fermat's theorem, to the list of all things implying it.

I.e. what would fermat's last theorem IMPLY. Do any of these things ring true or false? Can any of them be used as counterexample.



Built open the shoulers of giants. He used Langland's Bridge from the other direction from a way it was suggested for?
