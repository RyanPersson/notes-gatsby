Anki tips: (From some guy on hackerrank)
    
    I've spent many years using Anki and I have thousands of cards. I love it but I notice a few very common failure modes:
    1. Putting far too many cards in a deck.

    2. Putting in information that you want to learn rather than information you have already learned.

    3. Using large pre-made decks (which is really just 1 and 2 together).

    If you're planning on using Anki longterm (such as for language learning) then keep the number of new cards low. Something in the range of 3-5 a day is totally fine.

    You should put things into Anki after you have learnt them. In general I suggest putting in information at the end of a study session when you feel like you know it so well you couldn't possibly forget it. Cards should feel a bit too easy when you create them. By the time you come to review you will have forgotten a little and the difficulty will be perfect.
